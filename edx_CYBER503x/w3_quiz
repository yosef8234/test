The formula for determining adverse impact is:
Impact = Likelihood * Value

When determining threat likelihood, most processes look at a timeframe of:
One year

Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is:
The total amount of revenue that is lost from a single occurrence of the risk

The Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is:
The number of times an organization can reasonably expect the risk to occur during one year

Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) is:
The total amount of money an organization will lose in one year if nothing is done to mitigate the risk

Risk Management 2 Quiz

UNIT 3: Question 1
What are some sources to identify vulnerabilities? (Select all that apply)
*Existing security requirement checklists
*Previous risk assessment documents
*Reports from vulnerability scanning tools and penetration tests
*External vulnerability sources

UNIT 3: Question 2
Likelihood is:
The probability that a threat will occur
*The probability that a threat will occur against a vulnerability with existing controls in place
The probability that a vulnerability will be exploited

UNIT 3: Question 3
What is the formula for Impact Analysis?
ALE (Annual Loss Expectance) = SLE * ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)
*Magnitude of Risk Impact = Likelihood * Asset Value
Single Loss Expectance (SLE) = Exposure Factor * Asset Value

UNIT 3: Question 4
Which is the correct formula for cost-benefit analysis in the risk mitigation phase?
ROSI = (ALE after control) – (ALE before control) – (annual cost of control)
ROSI = (ALE after control) – (ALE before control) – (asset value)
*ROSI = (ALE before control) – (ALE after control) – (annual cost of control)

UNIT 3: Question 5
What are the two key components of risk?
Asset, Likelihood
*Magnitude of impact value, Likelihood
Threat, Magnitude of impact value

UNIT 3: Question 6
The well-formed risk statement always contains: (Select three)
*Asset value
*Existing controls
Single Loss Expectance (SLE)
Return On Security Investment (ROSI)
*Vulnerability-Threat pair

UNIT 3: Question 7
Which statement is not true about vulnerability?
Vulnerability is a weakness in the system.
*Vulnerability focuses on “what you are afraid of or are trying to avoid”
Vulnerability focuses on “how the threat could occur”

UNIT 3: Question 8
The Risk Matrix is a conventional qualitative risk assessment method that requires consistent definitions for: (Select three)
*Asset exposure level for vulnerability-threat pair
*Impact levels or effects
*Likelihood levels
Annual Loss Expectance (ALE)

UNIT 3: Question 9
Risk mitigation attempts to reduce risk by: (Select three)
Constant system monitoring
Limiting the asset exposure to the risk
Limiting the impact of the risk if it does occur
Reducing the probability or likelihood of the risk affecting your business
