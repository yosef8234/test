# Question 5

How do you keep track of different versions of your code?

# Answer:

Version control! At this point, you should act excited and tell them how you even use Git (or whatever is your favorite) to keep track of correspondence with Granny. Git is my preferred version control system, but there are others, for example subversion.

# Why this is important:

Because code without version control is like coffee without a cup. Sometimes we need to write once-off throw away scripts and that's ok, but if you are dealing with any significant amount of code, a version control system will be a benefit. Version Control helps with keeping track of who made what change to the code base; finding out when bugs were introduced to the code; keeping track of versions and releases of your software; distributing the source code amongst team members; deployment and certain automations. It allows you to roll your code back to before you broke it which is great on its own. Lots of stuff. It's just great.
